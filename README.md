Development of a licensing framework by utilizing the
methods of asymmetric cryptography, MD5, and digital signatures. Although the methods
that take place in symmetric cryptography are strong, they have some shortcomings such as
key publication for both receiver and sender. This could be a hard procedure if these two
counterparts live in different cities or they are geographically far away without having secure
communication. Moreover, symmetric cryptography is prone to ”man in the middle” attacks
which serve a potential vulnerability of changing the content of the message on the way to
the receiver.
